                Lesson preparation: First of all, we should prepare our lessons carefully and study the textbooks carefully. We should think carefully about where we should talk in detail and where we can talk less. In physics classroom teaching, we should do a good
                job in teaching basic knowledge such as physical concepts and laws, pay attention to the definition, meaning and characteristics of physical concepts, and let students deepen their understanding of abstract physics essentials through examples,
                drawings and other means as needed. In the explanation of physical laws, attention should be paid to guiding students to think through analysis, generalization, induction and other thinking activities. Lesson preparation is not only to
                prepare textbooks, but also to prepare students. In addition to carefully observing students' performance in class, we should also pay attention to communication with students. Learn about students' learning situation and personality,
                so as to better promote the smooth development of teaching work.

                Class: sufficient preparation of teaching materials and students, in the final analysis, is for better class. In the process of teaching, students are the main body, and it is the teacher's responsibility to let students learn knowledge well. In class,
                we should strive to achieve the teaching objectives of each class and get feedback from students in a timely manner. In class, different teaching methods should be adopted according to the classroom situation, so as to adapt to the situation,
                timely adjust, and better complete the teaching task. In addition, it is necessary to create a good classroom atmosphere.

                Assignments: Assignments should be targeted and hierarchical, and strive to maximize the effect of each exercise. At the same time, students' homework should be corrected in a timely and serious manner, their homework should be analyzed and recorded,
                their problems in the process of homework should be classified and summarized, thorough comments should be made, and teaching methods should be improved in a timely manner according to the relevant situation to achieve a targeted goal.
